I suggest that there should be atleast 1 week in every month where he should actually record his screen till he trade so that we should also get an idea on how he is able to pick the right stocks or atleast a live selection and trading process for all students which will help the people like us to know where we are missing on where we are struggle what are the major and minor misses from us . It has quite been a long time now where i am struggling from this and i do not know i check pre market , then i go to IB and money flux i see which stock are present in majority, i track them with ORB i enter yet i am in loss.

Like Money flux for Nifty/BankNifty/FinNifty shall you add a search tab for FnO stocks? Attached an screenshot of Money flux page. In that there should be a search box in which we need to enter the picked stock for trade. Money flux should show the trend bars of that stock like now it showing for Nifty/BankNifty/FinNifty. It will help greatly to identify the trend in that stock and decision taking for entry/exit will be much easier like now we are doing for NF/BNF/FNF options. Kindly look on this and add this feature. \\nThankyou.\\nPS: Resending the idea which I have shared at student support portal on 03-Aug-2023\"}"

I know we have a heat map of nifty,banknifty etc. but if you add a Heatmap which contains all the stocks then it might be helpful for everyone. A Suggestion from my side. Thanks  \"}"
